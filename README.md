# proto3dmonstermaze
 A 3D Monster Maze C++ console clone. You can freely use it as a base to make your own stuff!
 It's a fork of my previous project [proto3ddungeonmaze](https://github.com/veganlies2me/proto3ddungeonmaze).
 It uses Lee's algorithm for the pathfinding. Not the most efficient but it works.
